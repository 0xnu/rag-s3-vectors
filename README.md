A system using [Amazon S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to create a [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Shakespearean plays. The system is designed to answer questions about the plays based on the text and embeddings stored in the vector database.

### Prerequisite

Here are the steps to deploy your Shakespeare RAG system:

1. Manual S3 Vector Infrastructure Setup

Create Vector Bucket (AWS Console):
+ Navigate to Amazon S3 in us-east-1 region
+ Look for `Vector Buckets` in the sidebar (preview feature)
+ Create bucket named: `shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket`
+ Note: Must be globally unique, so add suffix if needed

Create Vector Index:
+ Within your vector bucket, create index: hamlet-shakespeare-index
+ Set dimensions to 1024 (Titan Embed v2 default)
+ Choose cosine distance metric
+ Exclude text metadata from filter targets (only title should be filterable)

2. AWS Bedrock Model Access

Enable Required Models:
+ Go to Amazon Bedrock console
+ Request access to `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`
+ Request access to `amazon.titan-text-premier-v1:0`
+ Wait for approval (usually immediate for Titan models)

### Deployment Commands

```sh
# Install SAM CLI via Homebrew
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli

# Verify installation
sam --version

# Build the SAM application
sam build

# Deploy with guided setup (first time)
sam deploy --guided

# Use these parameters when prompted:
# Stack Name: shakespeare-rag-system
# AWS Region: us-east-1 (or your preferred region)
# VectorBucketName: shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket
# VectorIndexName: hamlet-shakespeare-index

# For subsequent deployments
sam deploy

# To destroy everything deployed by SAM, use:
sam delete

# Delete S3 Vectors resources
aws s3vectors delete-index --vector-bucket-name "shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket" --index-name "hamlet-shakespeare-index" --region us-east-1
aws s3vectors delete-vector-bucket --vector-bucket-name "shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket" --region us-east-1
```

### Testing Locally

You can now test the system locally with Shakespearean queries:

```sh
# Test embedding generation
python3 -m src.query --test-embeddings

# Query with command line arguments
python3 -m src.query -q "Tell me about Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia"

# Interactive query mode
python3 -m src.query
```

### Testing API

Once deployed, test with Shakespearean queries:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://5hbsiaq1c4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How did Ophelia go mad?"}'

#### Example Shakespearean Test Queries
"What was the play within the play about?"
"Tell me about Hamlet'\''s feigned madness"
"What happened in the final duel?"
```

#### Response

```json
{"answer": "Ophelia goes mad due to her father's death and Hamlet's behavior towards her.", "sources": []}%
```
