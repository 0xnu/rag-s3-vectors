A system using [Amazon S3 Vectors](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/vectors/) and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to create a [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for Shakespearean plays. The system is designed to answer questions about the plays based on the text and embeddings stored in the vector database.

### Prerequisite

Here are the steps to deploy your Shakespeare RAG system:

1. Manual S3 Vector Infrastructure Setup

Create Vector Bucket (AWS Console):
+ Navigate to Amazon S3 in us-east-1 region
+ Look for `Vector Buckets` in the sidebar (preview feature)
+ Create bucket named: `shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket`
+ Note: Must be globally unique, so add suffix if needed

Create Vector Index:
+ Within your vector bucket, create index: hamlet-shakespeare-index
+ Set dimensions to 1024 (Titan Embed v2 default)
+ Choose cosine distance metric
+ Exclude text metadata from filter targets (only title should be filterable)

2. AWS Bedrock Model Access

Enable Required Models:
+ Go to Amazon Bedrock console
+ Request access to `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`
+ Request access to `amazon.titan-text-premier-v1:0`
+ Wait for approval (usually immediate for Titan models)

### Deployment Commands

```sh
# Install SAM CLI via Homebrew
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli

# Verify installation
sam --version

# Build the SAM application
sam build

# Deploy with guided setup (first time)
sam deploy --guided

# Use these parameters when prompted:
# Stack Name: shakespeare-rag-system
# AWS Region: us-east-1 (or your preferred region)
# VectorBucketName: shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket
# VectorIndexName: hamlet-shakespeare-index

# For subsequent deployments
sam deploy

# To destroy everything deployed by SAM, use:
sam delete

# Delete S3 Vectors resources
aws s3vectors delete-index --vector-bucket-name "shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket" --index-name "hamlet-shakespeare-index" --region us-east-1
aws s3vectors delete-vector-bucket --vector-bucket-name "shakespeare-rag-vector-bucket" --region us-east-1
```

### Testing Locally

You can now test the system locally with Shakespearean queries:

```sh
# Create searchable vector indexes
python3 -m src.create_index

# Test embedding generation
python3 -m src.query --test-embeddings

# Query with command line arguments
python3 -m src.query -q "Tell me about Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia"

# Interactive query mode
python3 -m src.query
```

#### Successful Response

```sh
# Query with command line arguments
# python3 -m src.query -q "Tell me about Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia"

### Testing API

Once deployed, test with Shakespearean queries:

```sh
# 1. Basic cURL example
curl -X POST \
  https://6y3pc5k09e.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: 8uNAa2dWzx3U5EasnC9HhfldaTjoXgLe" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me about Hamlet'\''s relationship with Ophelia"
  }'

# 2. Example with invalid API key (should return 403)
curl -X POST \
  https://6y3pc5k09e.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: invalid-key" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me about Hamlet'\''s relationship with Ophelia"
  }'

# 3. Example without API key (should return 403)
curl -X POST \
  https://6y3pc5k09e.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me about Hamlet'\''s relationship with Ophelia"
  }'
```

#### Successful API Response

```json
{
  "answer": "Hamlet's relationship with Ophelia is a complex one. Initially, Hamlet appears to be in love with Ophelia, but after his father's death, he becomes distant and cruel towards her. In Act II, Hamlet tells Ophelia to \"get thee to a nunnery,\" which is a harsh and hurtful thing to say. However, it's important to note that Hamlet is feigning madness at this point, and his harsh words may be a way of protecting Ophelia from the corruption of the court. Ophelia is deeply affected by Hamlet's behavior and eventually goes mad with grief after her father's death.",
